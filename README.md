# gameboy-tetris-tracker

This project is in a very early prototyping phase. You will need to tweek it to make it work, for example the bounding boxes for the screenshots are hardcoded. You will have to adapt them by hand.

## grabbing the bounding boxes

    python retrieve_bounding_box.py

Drag from left top corner to bottom right corner. Copy bounding box into image-processing.py file.

# Check if bounding boxes are correct

    python check.py

 Then look at the screenshots at screenshots/ folder. Do the fully show the scores and the lines without any borders? If not, reset your bounding boxes.
